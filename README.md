# Mission Impossible

Analysis of the card game Mission Impossible. The game works as follows:

1. Take a deck of cards and draw n_piles (typically 9) cards and lay them face up.
2. Guess whether the next card in the deck will be higher, lower, or equal to one of the face up cards.
3. If your guess is correct, replace the face up card with the newly drawn card.
4. If your guess is wrong, flip the pile over. It is now "destroyed".
5. The game continues until all piles are flipped over (a loss) or all cards in the deck are drawn (a win).
